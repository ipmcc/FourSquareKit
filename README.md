FourSquareSDK-iOS
=================

My "Comprehensive" iOS SDK for FourSquare v2. Still very much in development mode. 

Requires that you have a FourSquare key, secret, app URL. Replace those in UXRGlobals. 

Requires MKNetworkKit. Uses Pods. Download and do Pod install. 

Future Roadmap:

- Needs to be more kit-like and add a demo view / search to prove it actually works.
- More, better test coverage
- More dox
